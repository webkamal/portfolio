        , and I've been passionate about coding since I was a child. I fell in
        love with programming at a young age, spending countless hours learning,
        experimenting, and creating small projects. Over the years, this passion
        has grown into a career as a Full Stack developer, where I continue to
        build innovative solutions that solve real-world problems.

      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-foreground dark:text-white mt-4">
        As Iâ€™ve evolved in my career, Iâ€™ve expanded my expertise into new areas
        like Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), diving deep
        into neural networks and other cutting-edge technologies. But no matter
        how much I learn, I always keep that same excitement and curiosity I had
        as a child, exploring new fields and technologies that push the
        boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

      <p className="text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg text-foreground dark:text-white mt-4">
        Today, Iâ€™m not just focused on building apps and websites; Iâ€™m also
        exploring DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS to optimize and
        scale my projects. I believe in continuous learning and growth, and Iâ€™m
        always looking for new challenges that help me expand my skills.
